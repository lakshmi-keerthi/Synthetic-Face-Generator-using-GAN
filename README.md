# Synthetic-Face-Generator-using-GAN

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic, high-quality synthetic faces. The GAN consists of two primary components: the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in an adversarial setting. The dataset used is the CelebA dataset, which contains images of celebrity faces.
